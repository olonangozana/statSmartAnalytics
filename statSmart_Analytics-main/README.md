General Info 
. The problem at hand is that data scientists spend a significant amount of time and effort in manually extracting, cleaning, and analyzing data, which hampers their productivity and efficiency. The lack of an automated solution leads to repetitive and time-consuming tasks, making it challenging for data scientists to focus on the core aspects of their work, such as deriving insights and making data-driven decisions. The goal of this project is to develop an advanced data analyser software that automates the process of data extraction, cleaning, and analysis for data scientists. The software should streamline and simplify the data analysis workflow, enabling data scientists to efficiently extract, clean, and analyze data without manual intervention.The automated data analyser software aims to empower data scientists by automating time-consuming tasks and simplifying the data analysis process. It allows data scientists to focus more on deriving insights and making data-driven decisions, rather than spending significant time on repetitive data handling and analysis tasks.
